- 💡 **Smart Upselling**: AI suggests complementary items customers didn't order
- 📋 **Readback Script**: Generates confirmation dialogue for order accuracy
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API

## 📦 Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   Get your API key from: https://ai.google.dev

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Try It Out

1. Click one of the **sample orders** to populate the input field
2. Or **type your own** order in natural language
3. Or click **"Record Order"** to use voice input (Chrome/Edge recommended)
4. Click **"Parse Order"** to process with AI
5. Review the structured output with:
   - Itemized order breakdown
   - Price calculation
   - Customer info (if provided)
   - Ambiguities to clarify
   - Upsell suggestions
   - Confirmation script

### Example Orders

**Simple Order:**

```
Hi, I'd like two large pepperoni pizzas and a medium Coke.
```

**Complex Order:**

```
Yeah, can I get a large supreme pizza, no onions, extra cheese,
well done, an order of buffalo wings with medium sauce,
garlic breadsticks with extra marinara, and a large lemonade?
Oh, and my name is Brian, phone number is 555-1234.
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.tsx                 # Main application component
├── OrderInput.tsx          # Input component with voice/text entry
├── OrderDisplay.tsx        # Displays parsed order results
├── types.ts                # TypeScript type definitions
├── menuData.ts             # Restaurant menu and pricing data
├── openaiService.ts        # OpenAI API integration
├── utils.ts                # Helper functions (calculations, scripts)
└── index.css               # Tailwind CSS imports
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input**: User records or types a phone order
2. **AI Processing**:
   - Sends order transcript to GPT-4 with menu context
   - AI extracts structured data (items, quantities, mods)
   - Detects ambiguities and suggests upsells
3. **Calculation**: Prices each item based on menu data + tax
4. **Output**: Displays order ticket + confirmation script

## 🔧 Customization

### Update the Menu

Edit `src/menuData.ts` to customize:

- Menu items and categories
- Pricing (base prices and sizes)
- Available customizations
- Tax rate

### Change AI Model

In `src/openaiService.ts`, modify:

```typescript
model: "gpt-4o-mini"; // or 'gpt-4o', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

### Styling

All styles use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Customize colors and theme in `tailwind.config.js`.
